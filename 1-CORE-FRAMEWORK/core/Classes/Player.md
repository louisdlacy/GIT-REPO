# Player Class

Represents a player in the world. This is the primary class for managing an individual player's physical presence and game play in the world, including their avatar.

## Signature

```typescript
export declare class Player
```

## Constructors

| Constructor | Description |
| --- | --- |
| (constructor)(id) | Creates a player in the world. Signature constructor(id: number); Parameters id: numberThe ID of the player. |

## Properties

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| avatarScale | The scale of the player's avatar. Change this to scale the player up or down. Signature avatarScale: HorizonProperty<number>; Examples This example demonstrates how to modify the avatar scale of a player when it enters a trigger. class AvatarScalingExample extends hz.Component<typeof AvatarScalingExample> { static propsDefinition = { newAvatarScale: { type: hz.PropTypes.Number }, }; start() { this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.entity, hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerEnterTrigger, (player) => { player.avatarScale.set(this.props |
| deviceType | Gets the type of device the player is using. Signature deviceType: ReadableHorizonProperty<PlayerDeviceType>; Remarks New device types may be added in the future, so you should handle this property with a switch statement. |
| focusedInteraction | The FocusedInteraction instance associated with the player. Signature focusedInteraction: FocusedInteraction; Remarks Focused Interaction mode replaces on-screen controls on web and mobile clients with touch and mouse input that includes direct input access. For more information about Focused Interaction, see the Focused Interaction guide . |
| foot | The player's foot. Signature foot: PlayerBodyPart; |
| forward | The player's forward direction relative to the world origin. Signature forward: ReadableHorizonProperty<Vec3>; |
| gravity | The player's gravity before simulation. Signature gravity: HorizonProperty<number>; |
| head | The player's head. Signature head: PlayerBodyPart; |
| id [readonly] | The player's ID. Signature readonly id: number; |
| index | The index that identifies the player in the list of all players in the world instance. Signature index: ReadableHorizonProperty<number>; Examples This example demonstrates how to retrieve a Player object using a player index. var playerIndex = player.index.get(); var playerFromIndex = this.world.getPlayerFromIndex(playerIndex); Remarks When joing a world, each player is assigned an index, which ranges from 0 (the first player) to Max Players - 1. Use the index value to keep track of players and get a Player object using the World.getPlayerFromIndex() method. |
| isGrounded | Indicates whether the player is grounded (touching a floor). If a player is grounded then gravity has no effect on their velocity. Signature isGrounded: ReadableHorizonProperty<boolean>; |
| isInBuildMode | Indicates whether a player is in build mode. Signature isInBuildMode: ReadableHorizonProperty<boolean>; Remarks Build mode means the player is editing the world. The alternative, preview mode, is when they're playing the world. |
| jumpSpeed | The speed applied to a player when they jump, in meters per second. Setting this to 0 effectively disables a player's ability to jump. Signature jumpSpeed: HorizonProperty<number>; Remarks Default value is 4.3. jumpSpeed must be a value between 0 and 45. jumpSpeed.set can be called on any player from any context, but jumpSpeed.get will throw an error unless it's called from a local script attached to an object owned by the player in question. |
| leftHand | The player's left hand. Signature leftHand: PlayerHand; |
| locomotionSpeed | The speed at which the player moves, in meters per second. Signature locomotionSpeed: HorizonProperty<number>; Remarks Default value is 4.5. locomotionSpeed must be a value between 0 and 45. locomotionSpeed.set can be called on any player from any context, but locomotionSpeed.get will throw an error unless it's called from a local script attached to an object owned by the player in question. |
| name | The player's name displayed in the game. Signature name: ReadableHorizonProperty<string>; |
| position | The player's position relative to the world origin. Signature position: HorizonProperty<Vec3>; |
| rightHand | The player's right hand. Signature rightHand: PlayerHand; |
| rootRotation | The root rotation of the player's avatar. This is different from the Player.rotation property, which retrieves the player's head rotation. Signature rootRotation: HorizonProperty<Quaternion>; Examples class ServerRotate extends hz.Component<typeof ServerRotate> { static propsDefinition = { lookAtProp : { type: hz.PropTypes.Entity }, }; start() { this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.entity, hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerEnterWorld, (player: hz.Player) => { serverPlayer = player |
| rotation | The player's facing/head rotation relative to the world origin. For the rotation of the player's entire avatar, see the Player.rootRotation property. Signature rotation: ReadableHorizonProperty<Quaternion>; Examples var headRotation = serverPlayer.rotation.get(); |
| screenHeight | Gets the screen height of the screen surface the player is using. Signature screenHeight: ReadableHorizonProperty<number>; Remarks The returned value is the size of the renderable screen height in pixels, and is not guaranteed to match the actual player's device screen width. |
| screenSafeArea | Gets the safe area of the screen surface the player is using. Signature screenSafeArea: ReadableHorizonProperty<Rect>; Remarks The returned value is a screen space normalized rectangle, with values ranging from 0 to 1. To get actual safe area, scale it by screen width and height. i.e: screenSafeArea.scaleBy(screenWidth, screenHeight) |
| screenWidth | Gets the screen width of the screen surface the player is using. Signature screenWidth: ReadableHorizonProperty<number>; Remarks The returned value is the size of the renderable screen width in pixels, and is not guaranteed to match the actual player's device screen width. |
| sprintMultiplier | The multiplier applied to a player's locomotion speed when they are sprinting. Signature sprintMultiplier: HorizonProperty<number>; Examples This example demonstrates how to modify the player sprint multipliplier while it is inside a trigger. class SprintMultiplierExample extends hz.Component<typeof SprintMultiplierExample> { static propsDefinition = { modifiedSprintMultiplier: { type: hz.PropTypes.Number }, }; private defaultSprintMultiplier: number = 1.4; start() { this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.entity, hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerEnterTrigger, (player) => { |
| torso | The player's torso. Signature torso: PlayerBodyPart; |
| up | The player's up direction relative to the world origin. Signature up: ReadableHorizonProperty<Vec3>; |
| velocity | The player's velocity relative to the origin, in meters per second, due to physics and not locomotion input. Signature velocity: HorizonProperty<Vec3>; |
