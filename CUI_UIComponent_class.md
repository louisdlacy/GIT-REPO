UIComponent class
This topic describes the UIComponent class that is used to create custom UIs in your world. The script attached to a Custom UI gizmo extends the new 
UIComponent
 class instead of the regular 
Component
 class. UIComponent is similar to Component in many ways, for example, both can access the this.world object and listen to events. But the UIComponent class includes specialized properties and methods.
Properties: panelHeight and panelWidth
The two properties of the UIComponent class are panelHeight and panelWidth. The default panel size is 500 x 500 pixels. You can change the size by specifying the panelHeight and panelWidth properties.
class HelloWorld extends UIComponent {
  panelHeight = 200; // the default value is 500
  panelWidth = 460; // the default value is 500

  initializeUI() {
    return View({
      children: [Text({text: 'Hello World'})],
      style: {backgroundColor: 'white'},
    });
  }
}

UIComponent.register(HelloWorld);
You cannot change the panel size after the UI panel is initialized. Assigning new values to this.panelHeight or this.panelWidth has no effect at runtime. Therefore, the example above is the recommended way of defining panel sizes.
Note: The panel size of the UI panel is different from the scale of the UI gizmo. The panel size defines how many pixels you can draw inside the panel. Scale defines how big those pixels are. If the UI panel is a screen, scale controls its size, and panel size its resolution.
The following image shows two different sets of Scale attributes in Properties.

The following image shows the left UI gizmo is smaller than the right UI gizmo with Scale attribute of (1, 1, 1) vs. (2, 2, 2).

Method: initializeUI()
In the UIComponent class, 
initializeUI()
 is an important method that is used to define the content of the UI. When a UI gizmo is initialized, it calls initializeUI() to get the UI that the entity needs to render. Conceptually, this is what happens behind the scene:
// Conceptual; not real implementation
start() {
  this.entity.as(UIGizmo).setPanelSize({
    height: this.panelHeight,
    width: this.panelWidth,
  });
  this.entity.as(UIGizmo).setUI(this.initializeUI());

  // The rest of the start function are executed thereafter
}
While the initializeUI() method might remind some developers of the render() function in the React component class, they are fundamentally different in that initializeUI() is only called once in the lifecycle of the UI panel. When any props or variables are changed, the UI panel does not automatically re-render to reflect the changes in the dependent data.
There are ways to update the UI panel after it is initialized with 
Binding
. See Updating UI with Binding for more details. For now, remember that initializeUI() is only called once when the UI gizmo is initialized, before the start() method of the component.
Because both initializeUI() and start() are executed when the world or the UI gizmo starts, it’s not required for a UIComponent to provide an implementation for start(). When the world starts, if you’d like to connect to event handlers, you can place the code in either initializeUI() or start(). For example, the following two implementations have the same behavior:
Implementation 1
initializeUI() {
  this.connectEntityEvent(
    this.entity,
    myTsEvent,
    data => {...},
  );

  return View({...});
}
Implementation 2
initializeUI() {
  return View({...});
}

start() {
  this.connectEntityEvent(
    this.entity,
    myTsEvent,
    data => {...},
  );
}
However, keep in mind that initializeUI() is executed before start(). If the UI depends on some local variables, initialize them in initializeUI(), not start().
Components and props
As mentioned before, the 
initializeUI()
 method must return the UI that you want to render. You can build the UI with the components that are provided, e.g. 
View
, 
Text
, 
Image
, etc.
Essentially, these components are functions that take in an object of props and output an opaque UINode object, for example:
function View(props: ViewProps): UINode;
You do not need to know the internal implementation of UINode. You only need to know that the initializeUI() method must return a UINode.
Each component also takes an object of props, and the props type is different for each component type. For example, the following code defines a 
Text
 component with a 
text
and a
style
prop:
const text = Text({
  text: 'Hello World',
  style: {fontSize: 24},
});
You can find the detailed documentation on the props and styles supported by each component in API Reference for custom UI. Also see related details in the UI API(/reference/2.0.0/). For now, this topic briefly introduces the important common props, 
style
and
children
.
Prop: style
Most components include a style prop, which is the main tool to adjust the appearances of the components. It supports most of the stylesheets from CSS and React Native.
const view = View({
  style: {
    backgroundColor: '#EDE2D5',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    padding: 24,
    width: '100%',
  },
});
Different components support different sets of styles. Again, you can find detailed documentation on the supported styles in the API Reference for custom UI.
Prop: children
Similar to the UI you would find in other frameworks like HTML and React, the custom UI is also a tree structure, and a component may have children components. This is defined through the 
children
prop, which can be either one or an array of 
UINode
s.
const view = View({
  children: View({
    // children can be one UINode
    children: [
      // or an array of UINodes
      Text({text: 'Hello World'}),
      Text({text: 'This is a subtitle'}),
    ],
  }),
});
Not all components can have children. For example, you cannot assign children components to a Text component. You can refer to API Reference for custom UI to see which component props explicitly include a children prop.
It is acceptable and quite common to store a part of the component into its own variable, so that a large complex UI can be broken down into smaller parts, improving code readability. For example, the above component can also be written as the following:
const text1 = Text({text: 'Hello World'});
const text2 = Text({text: 'This is a subtitle'});
const content = View({children: [text1, text2]});
const view = View({children: content});
