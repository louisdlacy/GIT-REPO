**CodeBlock Achievements**
TypeScript provides methods and a CodeBlock event to check for and grant achievements when a player completes actions or feats in your world. Creators previously used CodeBlocks to handle player Achievements. Now, TypeScript enables more flexible development options.
**Note:** "Achievements" is a legacy name for Quests in Meta Horizon Worlds; at this time, Quests are still referrd to as Achievements in the TypeScript API.
The following TyepScript APIs are available for managing achievements:
* OnAchievementComplete CodeBlock event - This is a built-in CodeBlock event that is called when a player completes a specified achievement.
* Player.hasCompletedAchievement method - Verifies whether the player has completed the specified achievement.
* Player.setAchievementComplete method - Specifies whether a player has completed the given achievement.
**Example Code**

```
import * as hz from 'horizon/core';


class TestOnAchievementUpdate extends hz.Component<typeof TestOnAchievementUpdate> {
  static propsDefinition = {
    cube: {type: hz.PropTypes.Entity},
  };

  start() {
    this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.entity, hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnAchievementComplete, (player, scriptID) ==> {
      console.log("Achievement Updated! ScriptID: " + scriptID);
    });
  }
}
hz.Component.register(TestOnAchievementUpdate);

class TestGetAndSetAchievement extends hz.Component<typeof TestGetAndSetAchievement> {
  static propsDefinition = {};

  start() {
    this.connectCodeBlockEvent(this.entity, hz.CodeBlockEvents.OnPlayerEnterTrigger, (player: hz.Player) ==> {
      var scriptID = "winner";
      var hasAchievement = player.hasCompletedAchievement(scriptID);
      if (hasAchievement){
        player.setAchievementComplete(scriptID, false);
      } else {
        player.setAchievementComplete(scriptID, true);
      }
    });
  }
}
hz.Component.register(TestGetAndSetAchievement);
```
