# World Streaming vs Asset Spawning

## Use world streaming if:
- You want to spawn large chunks of static content.
- Content always spawns in the same location.
- You want optimized load times and better lighting.

## Use asset spawning if:
- You want to spawn smaller chunks of content.
- Content is dynamic or spawns in different locations.

Often, both strategies can be combined. For example:  
- Use world streaming for static environments.  
- Use asset spawning for dynamic, interactive elements.
