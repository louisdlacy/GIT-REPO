# Holster Icon Menu

The holster icon menu is a UI menu showing icons for items attached to a playerâ€™s avatar.  
Players can use these icons to **switch between and equip items**.  
Icons represent grabbable entities attached to the player.

> **Note:** The holster button appears if a player has more than one grabbable entity attached.

## Attaching a Grabbable Entity to a Player
For an item to appear in the holster icon menu when not equipped, attach it to the player:

```ts
this.entity
  .as(hz.AttachableEntity)
  .attachToPlayer(player, AttachablePlayerAnchor.Torso);
```

Combine with input action for controlled attachment:

```ts
this.connectCodeBlockEvent(
  this.entity,
  CodeBlockEvents.OnIndexTriggerUp,
  (player: Player) => {
    this.entity
      .as(hz.AttachableEntity)
      .attachToPlayer(player, AttachablePlayerAnchor.Torso);
  },
);
```
